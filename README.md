# Customer Portal Account

## Context
- There has been previous work done on a customer portal account in the last years. 
- Many of our services requires an account in one form or another, and we canâ€™t keep create different accounts for each of them
- Having a single account for our customers makes things easier for them but also for us as it will be easier to maintain
- We are focussing on an SE account to start with but want to keep it flexible enough so that it can potentially become an account our partners can use too in the future
- We are not replacing existing accounts for now, but want to use this for new services
